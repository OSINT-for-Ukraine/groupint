# Groupint

Groupint is an application developed by OSINT for Ukraine that enables investigators to scrape data from Telegram groups and connect ‚Äúwho‚Äôs talking to whom‚Äù through an intuitive and visually appealing graph user interface.

This tool empowers investigators to analyse networks within specific Telegram communities.

## About OSINT for Ukraine

[OSINT for Ukraine](https://www.osintforukraine.com/) is an independent non-profit foundation dedicated to using open-source intelligence to investigate international war crimes in relation to the Russo-Ukrainian war, Research Influence and Disinformation operations in Europe, and to provide OSINT and OPSEC advisory and training.

## Get started

### Acquire API credentials

Groupint is powered by [Telesint](https://telesint.dev/en/), a database of over 3 million open Telegram chats and tens of thousands of private chats. When you log in to Groupint, you are required to set up a session with Telesint to access data on Telegram groups. Provide your ``phone number``, ``API id`` and ``API hash`` and create your session.

Acquire the  ``API id`` and ``API hash`` from [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id). You need to do the following:
1. Sign up for Telegram
2. Log in to your Telegram account [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/).
3. Got to ["API development tools"](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and fill out the form
4. You will get your ``API id`` and ``API hash`` parameters required for user authorization.
5. For the moment, each number can only have one api id connected to it.
